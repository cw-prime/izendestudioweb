## Setup Checklist (First Time Only)

3. Click "APIs & Services" > "Library"
4. Search "Google Calendar API"
5. Click "Enable"

### ‚òê Step 2: Use Your Service Account
You already have a service account from Analytics setup. Just note the email address:

- Looks like: `your-service@project-123.iam.gserviceaccount.com`

### ‚òê Step 3: Share Your Calendar
1. Open https://calendar.google.com/
2. Find the calendar you want to use (or create "Izende Consultations")
3. Click ‚ãÆ (3 dots) > "Settings and sharing"
4. Scroll to "Share with specific people"
5. Click "+ Add people"
6. Paste the service account email from Step 2
7. Set permission: **Make changes to events**
8. Click "Send"

### ‚òê Step 4: Get Calendar ID
Still in Calendar settings:
1. Scroll to "Integrate calendar"
2. Copy the **Calendar ID**
3. Usually looks like: `youremail@gmail.com` or `abc123@group.calendar.google.com`

### ‚òê Step 5: Download Service Account Key
If you don't have it already:
1. Go to Google Cloud Console > "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"
2. Click your service account
3. Go to "Keys" tab
4. Click "Add Key" > "Create new key" > JSON
5. Save file as `calendar-service-account.json`

### ‚òê Step 6: Install Files
1. Place `calendar-service-account.json` in: `/var/www/html/izendestudioweb/`
2. Make sure it's listed in `.gitignore`

### ‚òê Step 7: Update .env File
Add these lines to `/var/www/html/izendestudioweb/.env`:

```env
# Google Calendar Configuration
GOOGLE_CALENDAR_ID=your-calendar-id@gmail.com
GOOGLE_CALENDAR_TIMEZONE=America/Chicago
GOOGLE_CALENDAR_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE=calendar-service-account.json
```

Replace `your-calendar-id@gmail.com` with the Calendar ID from Step 4.

### ‚òê Step 8: Install Google API Client
Run this command in your project directory:

```bash
cd /var/www/html/izendestudioweb
composer require google/apiclient:"^2.0"
```

If you don't have Composer:
```bash
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
php composer.phar require google/apiclient:"^2.0"
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Service account does not have access to calendar"
**Solution:** Make sure you shared the calendar with the service account email (Step 3)
- The email is in your JSON file as `client_email`
- Permission must be "Make changes to events"

### "Calendar ID not configured"
**Solution:** Check your .env file has `GOOGLE_CALENDAR_ID` set correctly
- Copy the Calendar ID from Google Calendar settings
- Don't use quotes in .env file

### "Google API Client not installed"
**Solution:** Run the composer command from Step 8
```bash
composer require google/apiclient:"^2.0"
```

### Events not appearing in calendar
**Solution:**
1. Check that service account has calendar access
2. Verify Calendar ID is correct in .env
3. Check error logs: `/var/log/apache2/error.log`

### No Google Meet link generated
**Solution:** This is normal for the first event. Google Meet links appear after event creation.
- Refresh the booking details modal
- Or just use the calendar event - Meet link is there too

## Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Create a Dedicated Calendar
Instead of using your main calendar, create a new one called "Client Consultations"
- Keeps business meetings organized
- Easy to share with team members
- Can have different colors/settings

### Tip 2: Calendar Permissions
Only give service account access to ONE calendar, not all calendars
- More secure
- Prevents accidental event creation in wrong calendar

### Tip 3: Email Notifications
In Google Calendar settings, you can customize:
- Who receives event notifications
- How far in advance
- SMS reminders (optional)

### Tip 4: Team Access
If you have a team, share the calendar with them:
- They can see all consultation bookings
- They can join the same Google Meet
- Everyone stays in sync

### Tip 5: Backup Plan
Always have a backup video conferencing option:
- Zoom link in booking notes
- Phone number for audio fallback
- Don't rely 100% on Google Meet

## What If I Don't Set This Up?

**No problem!** The booking system works perfectly without Google Calendar:
- Clients can still book consultations
- You still get email notifications
- You can manually create calendar events
- Everything else functions normally

**You can set up Calendar integration anytime in the future.**
