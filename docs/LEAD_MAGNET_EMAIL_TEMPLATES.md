✓ Transparent Pricing - No hidden fees or surprises
✓ 99.9% Uptime - Your site stays online

## Email 4: Educational Content (Day 5)

**Subject:** 5 Website Mistakes Costing You Customers (+ How to Fix Them)

**From:** Izende Studio Web <support@izendestudioweb.com>

**Body:**

```
Hi [First Name],

After 15 years in web development, I've seen these 5 mistakes over and over. They're KILLING conversions for small businesses.

The good news? They're all fixable.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

MISTAKE #1: SLOW LOADING SPEED
❌ Problem: 53% of visitors leave if a page takes more than 3 seconds to load
✅ Fix: Optimize images, use fast hosting, enable caching

MISTAKE #2: NOT MOBILE-FRIENDLY
❌ Problem: 60% of web traffic is mobile - if your site doesn't work on phones, you lose 60% of potential customers
✅ Fix: Responsive design that adapts to any screen size

MISTAKE #3: WEAK CALLS-TO-ACTION
❌ Problem: Visitors don't know what to do next
✅ Fix: Clear "Call Us," "Get Quote," or "Schedule Consultation" buttons

MISTAKE #4: MISSING LOCAL SEO
❌ Problem: You're invisible in "near me" searches
✅ Fix: Optimize for local keywords, claim Google Business Profile, get listed in local directories

MISTAKE #5: NO SSL CERTIFICATE (HTTPS)
❌ Problem: Google penalizes non-secure sites, browsers show warnings
✅ Fix: Install SSL certificate (we include this FREE with all hosting)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

HOW MANY OF THESE APPLY TO YOUR SITE?

We offer FREE website audits to identify issues and opportunities. No obligation, just honest feedback.

## Email Automation Setup

### Recommended Platform

**Mailchimp** or **Sendinblue** (both have free tiers)

### Setup Steps

1. **Create an Audience** called "Lead Magnet Downloads"

2. **Set up Automation** with these trigger conditions:
   - Trigger: Contact subscribes to "Lead Magnet Downloads"
   - Condition: Has tag "lead_magnet_downloaded"

3. **Create 7-Email Series** with delays:
   - Email 1: Immediate
   - Email 2: 1 day delay
   - Email 3: 2 days after Email 2
   - Email 4: 2 days after Email 3
   - Email 5: 2 days after Email 4
   - Email 6: 3 days after Email 5
   - Email 7: 4 days after Email 6

4. **Set up Segments** for tracking:
   - Opened Email 1
   - Clicked link in any email
   - Replied to email
   - Converted to customer

### Integration with Lead Capture Form

Update `/forms/lead-capture.php` to add contacts to your email platform via API.

**Example (Mailchimp API):**

```php
// After successful form submission
$mailchimp_data = [
    'email_address' => $email,
    'status' => 'subscribed',
    'merge_fields' => [
        'FNAME' => $name
    ],
    'tags' => ['lead_magnet_downloaded']
];

// Send to Mailchimp API
// (Add actual API call here)
```

---

## Best Practices

1. **Personalization**
   - Always use first name in subject and greeting
   - Reference their downloaded resource
   - Keep tone friendly and conversational

2. **Mobile Optimization**
   - Keep subject lines under 50 characters
   - Use short paragraphs (2-3 sentences)
   - Include clear CTAs that work on mobile

3. **Testing**
   - A/B test subject lines
   - Monitor open rates (target: >20%)
   - Monitor click rates (target: >3%)
   - Test send times (9-11 AM typically best)

4. **Compliance**
   - Include physical address in footer
   - Add unsubscribe link to every email
   - Honor unsubscribe requests within 24 hours
   - Follow CAN-SPAM regulations

5. **Metrics to Track**
   - Open rate by email
   - Click-through rate
   - Reply rate
   - Conversion rate (lead to customer)
   - Unsubscribe rate (<0.5% is healthy)
