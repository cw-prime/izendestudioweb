## üìß EMAIL TEMPLATES

### Email 1: Initial Outreach
```
Subject: Quick idea for [Business Name]

Hi [Name],

I was thinking about [Business Name] and realized your customers
probably visit your website after hours, right?

I just added a chatbot to my site that answers questions 24/7 -
even when I'm asleep. It's been capturing leads I would have
totally missed.

Would you want to see how it works? Takes 10 minutes to show you.

Let me know - Tuesday or Wednesday work for a quick call?

[Your Name]
314-312-6441
```

### Email 2: Follow-up (3 days later)
```
Subject: Re: Quick idea for [Business Name]

Hi [Name],

Just wanted to follow up on my email about the chatbot.

Not sure if you're interested, but here's what it does:
- Answers customer questions instantly
- Captures leads 24/7
- Takes 2 weeks to set up

If you're curious, let me know. If not, no worries!

[Your Name]
```

### Email 3: After Demo
```
Subject: [Business Name] Chatbot Proposal

Hi [Name],

Great talking to you today! As promised, here's the proposal
for your chatbot.

Setup: $797 one-time
Monthly: $147/month

Everything we discussed is included. Let me know if you have
questions or want to move forward.

[Attach proposal PDF]

Thanks,
[Your Name]
```
