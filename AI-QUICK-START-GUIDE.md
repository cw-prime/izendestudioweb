## Pricing Strategy

### Don't Charge Too Little!

**Bad:** "AI content is cheaper, so I'll charge less"
**Good:** "AI lets me deliver faster, so I can serve more clients"

**Your Value:**
- AI generates → You refine → Client gets quality
- Faster delivery = happy clients
- Human touch = not generic AI spam

### Pricing Formula:
1. Calculate your time: 4 hours/month
2. Your hourly rate: $100/hour = $400
3. Add tools cost: $100/month
4. Add profit margin: 25% = $125
5. **Total:** $625/month

Round down to $497 or $597 for marketing appeal.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **"I'll use 100% AI with no editing"**
- Clients will notice
- Quality suffers
- You get bad reviews

✅ **Do this:** AI draft → You edit → Quality content

---

❌ **"I'll offer AI for free to get clients"**
- Devalues your service
- Hard to raise prices later

✅ **Do this:** Charge properly from day 1

---

❌ **"I need to learn everything about AI first"**
- Analysis paralysis
- You'll never feel "ready"

✅ **Do this:** Learn basics → get 1 client → learn more → repeat

→ Ask ChatGPT: "How can I use you to create [X] for my clients?"

### "Client doesn't like the AI content"
→ Edit more! AI is your assistant, not replacement.

### "I'm spending too much time editing AI content"
→ Improve your prompts. More specific = better output.

### "Clients are skeptical of AI"
→ Show results, not technology. Focus on outcomes.
