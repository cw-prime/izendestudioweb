        <h2 id="sla-overview">Service Level Agreement (SLA)</h2>
        <p>This Service Level Agreement ("SLA") describes the availability, performance, and support commitments for Izende Studio Web hosting services and related managed services. This SLA is incorporated by reference into your service order or agreement.</p>

        <h2 id="uptime-commitment">1. Uptime Commitment</h2>
        <p>We commit to the following availability targets, measured monthly:</p>
        <div class="table-responsive">
          <table class="table table-bordered">
            <thead>
              <tr>
                <th>Plan</th>
                <th>Uptime Commitment (monthly)</th>
              </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
              <tr>
                <td>Shared Hosting / Starter</td>
                <td>99.9%</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>VPS / Business</td>
                <td>99.9%</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Dedicated / Enterprise</td>
                <td>99.95%</td>
              </tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>
        </div>

        <h3 id="uptime-calculation">Uptime Calculation &amp; Exclusions</h3>
        <p>Uptime is calculated as: (Total minutes in the month - Downtime minutes) / Total minutes in the month &times; 100. Downtime is measured from the time we confirm an incident affecting multiple customers or the specific service instance until service is restored.</p>
        <p>Downtime does not include outages or unavailability caused by:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Scheduled maintenance (we will provide advance notice where practicable)</li>
          <li>Customer-caused issues, including misconfiguration or third-party integrations</li>
          <li>Force majeure events beyond our reasonable control (natural disasters, acts of government, cyberwarfare)</li>
          <li>Third-party services or networks beyond our control (upstream ISPs, public cloud provider incidents where we act as a reseller)</li>
          <li>Denial-of-service attacks where mitigation requires action by upstream providers</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="service-credits">2. Service Credit Table</h2>
        <p>If we fail to meet the uptime commitment for an affected service, you may be eligible for service credits calculated as a percentage of the monthly service fee for the impacted service during the measurement period. Service credits are the sole and exclusive remedy for SLA failures and are subject to the claim process below.</p>
        <div class="table-responsive">
          <table class="table table-bordered">
            <thead>
              <tr>

        <h2 id="maintenance">3. Scheduled Maintenance</h2>
        <p>We will provide reasonable notice for scheduled maintenance windows where possible. Maintenance windows may be performed during off-peak hours; we will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify affected customers at least 48 hours in advance for non-emergency maintenance.</p>

        <h2 id="support-response-times">4. Support Response Times</h2>

        <p>We monitor service health, apply security patches, and maintain backups according to plan specifications.
