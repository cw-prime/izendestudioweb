## Sales Process (What to Say)

### **Email Template:**

**Subject:** Quick idea for [Business Name]

```
Hi [Name],

I was thinking about [Business Name] and had an idea that
might help you.

A lot of your customers probably visit your website after hours
or when you're busy. Right now, they either leave or wait for
you to call back.

What if they could get instant answers to common questions
24/7? That's what a chatbot does.

It's like having someone answer the phone all night, but costs
way less than an employee.

Want to see how it works? I can show you a quick demo -
takes 10 minutes.

Available Tuesday or Wednesday?

[Your Name]
314-312-6441
```

### **On the Call:**

**1. Show, Don't Tell (5 min)**
- "Let me show you how it works on my website"
- Go to your site, open chatbot
- Ask it a question, show response
- "See? Instant answer. Works 24/7."

**2. Ask Questions (3 min)**
- "What questions do customers usually ask you?"
- "How many inquiries do you miss after hours?"
- "Ever lose a lead because you couldn't respond fast enough?"

**3. Make the Offer (2 min)**
- "We can set this up on your site for $797"
- "Then it's $147/month to keep it running and updated"
- "Most businesses see it pay for itself in the first month with just one extra customer"

**4. Close**
If yes: "Great! I'll send you an agreement today and we can have this live next week."

If maybe: "Want me to send you some examples of businesses using this?"

If no: "No problem. Keep my info in case you change your mind."

## Who to Target First

### **Best Clients for Chatbots:**

1. **Service businesses with lots of FAQs**
   - HVAC, plumbing, electrical
   - Dental, medical practices
   - Lawyers, accountants

2. **Businesses that get inquiries after hours**
   - Restaurants (hours, menu questions)
   - Retailers (do you have X in stock?)
   - Auto shops (appointment booking)

3. **E-commerce**
   - "Where's my order?"
   - "What's your return policy?"
   - Product questions

4. **Your existing clients**
   - Already trust you
   - Know you do good work
   - Easy upsell

### **Red Flags (Don't Waste Time):**
- Super small business (1-2 people) - they might not need it
- Very low website traffic (<100 visitors/month)
- Client who wants to "think about it for 6 months"

---

## Q&As You'll Get (Be Ready)

**"Can't I just use the free version?"**
→ "Sure, but it only handles 50 conversations/month and doesn't have the AI features. Most businesses hit that in the first week. Plus, you won't get my setup and ongoing support."

**"What if it gives wrong answers?"**
→ "We program it with YOUR information. It only answers questions we set up. If it doesn't know something, it asks for their contact info so you can follow up."

**"How is this different from a contact form?"**
→ "Contact forms make people wait. This gives instant answers. And it can have a conversation - 'What are you interested in?' → Narrows it down → Shows relevant info. Much better experience."

**"Can it book appointments?"**
→ "Yes! It can capture their info and preferred times, then you confirm. Or we can integrate with your calendar system for extra."

**"What if people prefer talking to humans?"**
→ "They can! There's always a 'Talk to a human' button. The chatbot just handles the simple stuff so you can focus on the important conversations."

This reminds them of the value = they keep paying.

## What Could Go Wrong (And Fixes)

**Problem:** Client's website gets very few visitors
**Fix:** Set expectations upfront. "You might only get 5-10 conversations per month." Charge less or don't offer it.

**Problem:** Chatbot gives wrong answer
**Fix:** Check the Q&As, update immediately, tell client it's fixed. Offer one free month if it's your fault.

**Problem:** Client wants constant updates
**Fix:** Set expectations: "Updates included in monthly fee: up to 5 Q&A changes per month. Extra updates are $47/hour."

**Problem:** You get too many clients to manage
**Fix:** Hire someone on Upwork ($15/hour) to handle Q&A updates. You keep sales and strategy.

## Real Talk: Will This Work?

**Yes, if:**
- You target businesses that actually get website visitors
- You set it up properly (not half-assed)
- You follow up with clients monthly
- You show them the value (send reports)

**No, if:**
- You try to sell it to businesses with no website traffic
- You oversell ("It'll 10× your leads!")
- You set it up and never check on it
- You charge too little and resent the work

**The key:** Pick good clients, deliver solid work, show results.
